This Angular web application uses the Reddit API to allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.\
This project was built to practice working with **Angular** and **TypeScript**.\
This project was also built using **React** and **Redux** [here](https://github.com/makarovangelika/reddit-client).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\

When the users click on the link of the subreddit in the post or in the menu they can see the list of subreddit's posts.\
When the users click on the post in the list they are navigated to the separate route for an individual post. On this page they can see the post and the comments which are displayed with nested replies.
